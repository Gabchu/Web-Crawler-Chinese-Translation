# Web-Crawler-Chinese-Translation
Web crawling products from a website using simplified chinese, and using a php converter to convert simplified chinese to traditional chinese.
## First Step
From a php page, I manage to find all the conversion from simplified to traditional (Or vice versa) translation. I made a php file to convert it to json file.
## Second Step
I create the converter and crawler file. I need to make sure converter is working normally, converting the simplified version to the traditional version of chinese. And crawler is crawling the correct resource from the actual url.
## Third Step
I create the main.py, inputting the conversion and crawled resources, and output them to a file.

It is a simple project, but demonstrate important skills for a web crawler to work.
